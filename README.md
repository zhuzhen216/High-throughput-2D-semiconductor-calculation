# POSCAR_generation
The script can convieniently generate structures of isoelectronic group V, IV-VI, and III-VII compounds. The realized features are:

Three most stable phases of 2D P (black, blue P, and also monolayer cubic phase) are selected as the basis. On top of these three phases, the code can generate structures of other isoelectronic systems: (a) keep the fractional coordinates; (b) scale
the lattice parameter based on atomic radius.

Output POSCAR files and they are stored in different folders. You need to initialize the folder path "folder_dir = your path" 

POTCAR files are also set up automaticly by the code, saved in the same folder as the structures. You need to give the path that store your POTCAR files "POTCAR_dir = your path".
