# POSCAR_generation
I use this script to generate isoelectronic group V, IV-VI, and III-VII compounds. The realized feature are:
1. Two most stable phases of 2D P (black and blue P) are selected as the basis. On top of these two phases,
the code can generate structures of other isoelectronic systems: (a) keep the fractional coordinates; (b) scale
the lattice parameter based on atomic radius.
2. Output POSCAR files and they are stored in different folders.
3. POTCAR files are also set up automaticly by the code.
